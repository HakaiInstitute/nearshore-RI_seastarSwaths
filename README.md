## Summary

This data package is a component of the Hakai Institute’s Nearshore research and monitoring program. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations. 

The Rocky Intertidal program is a subset of Hakai Nearshore, and is designed to quantify change in rocky shore intertidal habitats and their associated communities. Please see the list of all Rocky Intertidal program data packages here:

## Methods

This data package collects data and information relating to seastar 
population surveys conducted in the rocky intertidal of Calvert Island BC, 
starting in 2018. Counts and size measurements of sea stars and large macroinvertebrates were done in irregular plots at each site. For a detailed description, please see the Rocky Intertidal protocol contained in this dataset.
